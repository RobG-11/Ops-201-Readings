## **Why topics matters as it relates to module**
- Our lab is focused on backing up a Windows VM .ova file, the reading material is focused on using System Restore in Windows, which is what is typically used to restore a host based Windows OS. Both ultimately serve the same purpose.

## **Reading Notes**
- **Windows System Restore**
    - Lets you revert to previous software, registry, and driver configuration called a **restore point**, undoing last major change to Windows
    - Usually takes anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes

    - **Control Panel -> System -> System Protection -> System Restore**
        - Select **Next >**, than select restore point from list
        - Check **Show more restore points** to see older restore points
        - Once restore point is selected, select **Next >**
    - Confirm restore point in new window, can select **Scan for affected programs** to see OS impact on computer
        - To confirm and exit select **Finish**
    - New window appears, **Once started, System Restore cannot be interrupted**, select **Yes**
        - Will now begin reverting to selected restore point
        - System Restore window says **Preparing to restore your system...**
        - Next you'll see **Please wait while your Windows files and settings are being restored**
        - Process will take approximately 15 minutes, computer then restarts
    - Sign into Windows as normal
        - On Desktop should see window displaying **System Restore completed successfully**
- **More About System Restore & Restore Points**
    - Will not affect non-system files like docs, music, video, emails, etc.
    - Windows should regularly create restore points at critical junctures
        - Prior to a patch being applied
        - Before a new program is installed
    - System Restore can be started from command line by executing **rstrui.exe**
        - For when you need to run it from Safe Mode or limited-access situation

## **Things I want to know more about**
- Is there somewhere in Windows where you can set when to auto create restore points?
